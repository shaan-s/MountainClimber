# Gameplay
The objective of the game is to traverse to the endpoint (flag) in a randomly generated map. There are four elevation types, and the player must not travel to sleeply (e.g. Low to Medium is allowed, but not Low to High). The game ends if this mistake is made. There are 10 difficulty settings, and 4 colour scheme options:

A secondary goal is to reach the endpoint in as few moves as possible. The game also includes sound effects.

# Installation

`pip install colorama`

`git clone https://github.com/shaan-s/MountainClimber`

Then run `mountain.py`.
